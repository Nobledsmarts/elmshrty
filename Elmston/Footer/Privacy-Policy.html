          <br>Elmston.com is owned and operated by Elmston International Property Consultants, Inc. (""), a subsidiary of Elmston International Group Inc.  understands that you care about how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with our websites, email, social media sites/handles, and other services provided to you in the course of our business (including online services) (our “Services”), and we value the trust you place in us. <br>
          <br>ATTENTION CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: For information about your rights under California law, see the “Your California Privacy Rights” section below. <br>
          <br>In using our Services, you may occasionally provide information, such as your name, your contact information, or other information about yourself to  or other Elmston International entities, our service providers, or other businesses which you may contact while using the Services.  and these other entities may use this information and other technical information about your use of our Services to tailor their presentations to you, to facilitate your use of our Services or to communicate separately with you. We also may share personal information with other companies ("Third Parties") as described in this policy or at the time that your information is collected. In certain circumstances, you may have the opt-out to limit our sharing of your information, as described below. <br>The following describes how we collect, use and share your Personal Information. <br>
          <br>1. What Personal Information does elmston.co collect from you? <br>
          <br>elmston.co collects information in several ways and from different parts of our web site and Services. <br>
          <br>Some Personal Information is gathered when you sign up for our communications, enter a site feedback or contact form, or complete a client satisfaction survey. During the on-line registration process, for example, elmston.co may ask for your name, email address, telephone number, postal code, occupation, industry information and professional interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to assist you with your real estate needs. <br>
          <br>2. What are cookies and how does elmston.co use them? <br>
          <br>As part of offering customized and personalized on-line services, elmston.co uses cookies to store information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies allow elmston.co to provide you with a more personalized experience when you visit our sites, to customize the information that you receive as part of any communications and to be able to contact you when we have properties or information that you have requested. <br>
          <br>If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you will still be able to access most of the areas on this site. However, please note that if you disable all optional cookies using your browser, certain features of elmston.co may not be available. <br>
          <br>3. How does elmston.co use Personal Information? <br>
          <br>elmston.co's primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. By knowing a little about you, elmston.co is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. elmston.co may carry out research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this in order to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Subject to applicable laws,  may share aggregated user data with advertisers or business partners. <br>
          <br>4. Does elmston.co share my information with outsiders? <br>
          <br>From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from Third Parties. If you choose to receive information from these Third Parties, elmston.co will share your Personal Information them. <br>
          <br>HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT AS PART OF ITS PRIVACY POLICY  RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH WE, IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IF SUCH INFORMATION MAY CREATE A LIABILITY FOR US OR MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE ALL OR PART OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO US BY OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER SUPPLIERS. <br>
          <br>5. What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information? <br>
          <br>elmston.co may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from elmston.co, we may occasionally send you direct mail about services which we feel may be of interest to you. At any time you can easily edit your elmston.co account information and other subscription preferences to no longer receive such offers and mailings. <br>
          <br>6. How does elmston.co protect my personal and business-related information? <br>
          <br> takes reasonable steps to safeguard your Personal Information from perpetrators of fraud or internet piracy. <br>
          <br>We recommend that you sign out of your elmston.co account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This will help ensure that others cannot access your Personal Information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or an Internet cafe. <br>
          <br>PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NO DATA TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE 100% SECURE. AS A RESULT, WHILE WE STRIVE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, elmston.co,  OR Elmston INTERNATIONAL CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. ONCE WE RECEIVE YOUR TRANSMISSION, WE MAKE OUR BEST EFFORT TO ENSURE ITS SECURITY ON OUR SYSTEMS. <br>
          <br>7. What else should I know about my privacy? <br>
          <br>Elmston International, and its members have international sites and users all over the world. When you give elmston.co Personal Information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country or jurisdiction where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever elmston.co handles Personal Information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, elmston.co takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use Agreement and this Privacy Policy. <br>
          <br>Please keep in mind that whenever you disclose Personal Information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. <br>
          <br>8. Your California Privacy Rights <br>
          <br>Persons with disabilities may obtain this notice in alternative format upon request by contacting us at talkto@elmston.co. <br>
          <br>California Consumer Privacy Act <br>
          <br>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information. The CCPA defines “Personal Information” as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a specific federal privacy law, such as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act. <br>
          <br>To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. <br>
